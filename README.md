# Welcome to my Github.io site!
This is a repository of my Github.io website, which plans to feature all my past projects from my different classes. I'm a busy student, so these updates will happen gradually, but hopefully I will be able to accomplish these during my breaks

# To do list
- Add actual themes to the site
- Show off my past projects!
- Find time to actually do these lmao
